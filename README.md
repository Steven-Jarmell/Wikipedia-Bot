## How to Install Wiki
I am not personally running off this server, so the only way to run it is locally  
1. Add the bot to your server using this [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=860533750478929950&permissions=0&scope=bot)
2. Navigate to where you wish to download this repository
3. Open command line and type `git clone https://github.com/Steven-Jarmell/Wikipedia-Bot.git`
4. Use cd to navigate into the folder and run this command to download the wikipedia python package: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Put your token into the bottom of wiki.py where it says **YOUR TOKEN HERE**  
If you do not know your discord token, watch this video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEgFvgg7ZPI) 
6. Run the bot through the command line by typing `python wiki.py`
